# HyperledgerLab

**HyperledgerLab** is a clean, focused, and hands-on blockchain learning repository where I’m mastering **Hyperledger Fabric** — the leading enterprise-grade permissioned blockchain platform — through self-study and practice.

It’s part of the my Masters Thesis / Research, and is designed to offer:

✅ A deep understanding of Fabric’s architecture
⚙️ Step-by-step network setup using Docker
📦 Chaincode development with Go
🔐 Identity & certificate authority management
🔄 Full transaction lifecycle and endorsement policies

> Inspired by the official [LFS270](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/hyperledger-fabric-design-develop-and-deploy-lfs270/) syllabus — without taking the paid course!

Build in progress.
